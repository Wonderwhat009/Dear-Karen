  <h1>Not so Dear Karen</h1>

  <section>
    <p>To our wonderful, friendly neighbors: we are sorry about this display.</p>
    <p>On July 21 2025, my family and I discovered a deeply offensive, trashy, and vile hand‚Äëwritten, double‚Äësided sign attached to our lawn tractor ‚Äì positioned so it was visible from both the street and our house.</p>
    <p>In this 8√ó11 sign, our family was called disgusting and our house described as an eyesore.</p>
    <p>The author didn‚Äôt sign their name, but took it upon themselves to speak on behalf of the entire neighborhood. They demanded we ‚Äúshow respect‚Äù for the community by cleaning our ‚Äúdisgusting selves up‚Äù ‚Äì citing things like cutting grass, not parking trailers near the road and not having random things.</p>
    <p>My wife and I were very deeply disturbed by this attack as it has poisoned our enjoyment of our property and created a hostile, unpleasant atmosphere for us on our street.</p>

  <section>
    <h2>To the Karen who made the sign:</h2>
    <p>You claimed to care about respect for ‚Äúthe neighborhood,‚Äù yet you chose to treat your actual neighbors in the trashiest way imaginable.</p>
    <p><strong>What you did is harassment.</strong></p>
    <p>My family is not disgusting ‚Äî but your actions absolutely are. If you truly care about this community, come to our door and apologize. That‚Äôs what respectful neighbors do.</p>
    <p>Please do raise yourself to the standards of basic human decency and take responsibility for what you did. Once you do, this display will be immediately taken down and all will be well again.</p>

    <p>---------</p>
    <p>To our wonderful friendly neighbors:</p>
    <p>The sign you scanned is being displayed as of July the 22nd ‚Äì it may turn into some kind of trashy art before we get our apology.</p>
    <p>Thanks for bearing with us! If you know the Karen responsible, please do send her our way to apologize.</p>
    <p><strong>Hope to see you all at our next Party! ü•≥</strong></p>
